# UCSD KRG Advanced Ventilator Control Project
This is the control project under the KRG advanced ventilator project at UCSD. The project is at the very start and currently we are trying to build a closed-loop control for the pressure control ventilation (PCV). The related material is in the folder PCV. We aim to complete the matlab/simulink simulation for the control circuit by the start of the 2021 winter quarter.
